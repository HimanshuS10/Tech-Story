            <h1>The Story Behind Our 37-Year-Old Ceramics Manufacturing Business</h1>
            <p>Hi, I’m Himanshu Seervi. I’m the founder of Tech MasterMind.
                I’m am planning on posting a blog every month to record my journey.
                Little Bit About Me:
                I actually a unviersyt student going into 2nd year in September 2024 taking software engineering in
                Canada. I use to have 2 businesses one was a marketing agency offering short-form content and other was
                a AI Automation Agency. My marketing agency was running pretty good I made around $100-$200 per month. I
                know its not a lot LOL.
                While I am building Tech MasterMind, I am actually working my first intern at Steel Factory as a IT
                Student.
                What is Tech MasterMind?
                Tech MasterMind is a website where I will interview a bunch techpreneur and software write about there
                journey.
                I wanna interview techpreneur, basically founder that started a tech/software company, to see how they
                got started.
                I also wanna interview a bunch of 9-5 developer on how they landed they first job and there journey up
                to this point.
                I feel like there a lot of myth going around the world first being that working 9-5 job is running your
                life and second that it is impossible to get a CS intern in this job market. Now even I think that
                getting a intern in this job market is hard, well at least in Canada.
                Which is why I wanna interview developer so that current CS student can have a blueprint that they can
                follow to giving them self a higher chance than other.
                And first myth yea I don’t believe that (The effect of social media and how it has changed how we
                think).
                Challeneges:
                I only worked on this only for only 3 days and I came across a few Challenges that I need overcome.
                First is getting a few people for interview. I have done a few cold email already but the main problem
                is finding people who I can interview. I use youtube and blogs as a starting point but I need to come up
                with a better plan.
                Second problem is center a button on my website LOL SERIOUS.
                How I came up with this idea? Why is this a good idea?
                So as I mentioned that I am going into second year and most student including me start working on side
                projects that they can put on there portilifo. When I VSCode I had no idea what I wanted to build I
                scrolled on youtube to get any inspire for some project ideas.
                Then I came across Pat Walls, founder of Starter Story, I already know Pat before I followed his
                journey. I actually rewatched one of his video called “How I Built A $1M Business From This Starbucks”
                and he says “I can turn these questions into a product”, which spark an idea that I start some similar
                to starter story.
                So I started Tech MasterMind which is obviously inspired by Starter Story, and I added a own twist to
                it.
                Then Im like what if I make some thing that help current student guide them to the right direction. And
                even inspire some enpreuar to start there own tech company.
                Now here is the best part I can part this business on to my portilifo which is look impressive since I
                made something that is trying to solve a problem. So is a WIN-WIN.
                Monthly Goal:
                So I got this idea to start Tech MasterMind on July 23, 2024, and I am writing this on the 26th so
                there’s not too much days left.
                So I my main goal for this month is to finish developing the website and deploying to the web with at
                least 3 blogs posted. And as well as setting up google analysis which I don’t know how to do. But
                hopefully I can search it up and figure it out
                I’ll keep you guys posted see you next month and don’t forget to subcribe by clicking the button below.
                Thanks for reading!
